# Overengineered

by Sean O'Rourke, ...

Welcome to Overengineered's Developer Guide! This text assumes you have an
understanding of programming and programming concepts.

A good portion of the tech stack is in Rust. Though this text does not require
you to have a strong Rust background, you should be familiar with the
[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html). If you haven't
read it, everything's shiny captain. Not to fret. If you have experience with
Python or React, it's well written and not difficult to get through.

In this text we'll take a journey through concepts that make up Overengineered
and how we are tackling the big decentralization challenges that is inspiring
the next version of the web. Once we get a sense for the concepts we'll begin
to develop a **TODO** app. Starting with the bare features and slowly
developing it into a modern decentralized app.

We will be _not_ be going into great depth into each of the subjects covered in
this book. We will try to introduce you to concepts in a logical manor where
you have an idea on where to look to unblock yourself or find additional
resources.
