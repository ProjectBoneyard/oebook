# Hosting a Yew App

Hosting a Yew App with Rocket is pretty easy. All you need to do is host the
static files by returning a NamedFile for your route. Let's take a look at how
we would expose a webmanifest file.

```rust,ignore
mod static_files {
  use rocket::fs::{relative, NamedFile};
  use std:path::Path;

  $[get("manifest.webmanifest")]
  pub async fn manifest() -> Option<NamedFile> {
    let path = Path::new(relative!("../client/manifest.webmanifest"));
    NamedFile::open(path).await.ok()
  }

```
