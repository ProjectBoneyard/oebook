# Launch with Rocket

Yew is great for building interactive client side applications. However some
times we need to request data from a server, or maybe we want to perform server
side rendering, where we use yew to generate the HTML on a server and slowly
hydrate parts of the application as data is available.

[Rocket](rocket.rs) is a web framework for Rust that makes it simple to write
fast, secure web applications.

Rocket has great documentation, for this chapter let's head over to the
[getting started](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/getting-started/) page and
reproduce the example.

## Running Example in Overengineered Development Environment

To be able to run the Hello Rocket example we'll have to set the address like
we did with trunk. Rocket expects configuration to be placed in the
`Rocket.toml` file at the root of the project folder.

```rust,ignore
[default]
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000
```

Now we can run with cargo:

```rust,ignore
cargo run
```
