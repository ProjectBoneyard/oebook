# Command Line Interface

The development environment ships with a command line tool to help take care of
a lot of the boilerplate and configuration within Overengineered.

This tool is not meant to replace existing command line tools, but address
common tasks such as, setting up a new cloud, set up a new progressive web app,
setting up boilerplate templates, installing, and uploading apps to
repositories.

If you are using the Overengineered Development Environment the CLI comes
preinstalled and can be accessed with `oecli`.

For more details on the specific command line options that are available you
can use the help section.

```rust,ignore
oecli --help
```

We will dive into more details into the individual commands in the upcoming
chapters on an as needed basis.

## Manual Installation

If you are not within the Overengineered dev environment you can install
`oecli` through Cargo.

```rust,ignore
cargo install oecli
```
